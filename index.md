## About Me
My name is Ricardo Guerrero. I am an aspiring computer programmer who wishes to work in the software or gaming industry after earning my degree. My hobbies are reading fiction novels, watching anime, and playing video games on the Nintendo 3DS, PS5, or PC. I've always loved learning about technology since I was a little kid, whether it was the classroom projectors or the library computers. Sometime in middle school, I got my own laptop and started playing video games for the first time on PC, and I fell in love with how games were made. That's when I decided I wanted to spend my life learning and working in the computer science industry.
